Interactive course materials for understanding static and dynamic aeroelastic instabilities using the typical section model.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This 10-hour short doctoral course (1 ECTS credit) provides a hands-on introduction to aeroelastic phenomena through computational exercises. The goal is to allow participants with no specific background in aerospace engineering and prior programming experience in Python to explore the phenomena of divergence and flutter using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental physics of aeroelastic instabilities
- Model and analyze static divergence for the typical section
- Understand quasi-steady aerodynamics and the heave approximation
- Analyze flutter for the 2-DOF typical section using quasi-steady aerodynamics

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of structural dynamics and vibrations
- Familiarity with differential equations
- Basic programming experience (Python helpful but not required)
- Your own laptop for hands-on exercises

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Run in the Cloud (Recommended for beginners)

Click one of these badges to launch the notebooks in your browser - no installation needed!

- **Binder:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fmamitrotta/aeroelastic-instabilities-jupyter/main)
