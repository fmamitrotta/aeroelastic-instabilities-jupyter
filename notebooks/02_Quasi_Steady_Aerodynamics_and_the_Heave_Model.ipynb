    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will start using **Quasi-Steady Aerodynamics** to model the aerodynamic forces on an airfoil in motion. Before we write equations, let's visualize the physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the airfoil below. It's immersed in a uniform flow at speed $V$ with zero angle of attack, but at the same time is moving straight down with a velocity $\\dot{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the wing is moving down, the relative wind comes from slightly below. This creates the **effective angle of attack** $\\alpha_h$, which in turn generates lift.\n",

    "### The Velocity Triangle\n",
    "Imagine you are sitting on the wing moving down.\n",
    "1. The wind $V$ is coming at you horizontally.\n",
    "2. Because you are moving down, it feels like an updraft of velocity $\\dot{h}$ is coming up at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we can define this effective angle of attack using trigonometry:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_h = \\tan^{-1}\\left(- \\frac{\\dot{h}}{V}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we assume that the flight speed is much greater than the vertical speed ($V \\gg \\dot{h}$), we can approximate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_h \\approx - \\frac{\\dot{h}}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In quasi-steady aerodynamics, this is called the **heave approximation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is there a negative sign?** By convention, we consider $\\dot{h} > 0$ moving upwards. If the wing is moving up ($\\dot{h} > 0$), the relative wind comes from above, resulting in a negative effective angle of attack. Conversely, if the wing is moving down ($\\dot{h} < 0$), the relative wind comes from below, resulting in a positive effective angle of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about this for a second. Essentially, we're saying that the airfoil sees a change in angle of attack in the \"opposite direction\" to its vertical motion. In turn, this change in angle of attack results in a change in lift force that also acts in the opposite direction to the motion. This is a damping effect!\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for our first notebook, it makes sense to ask ourselves how bigger the flight speed $V$ must be compared to the vertical speed $\\dot{h}$ for this approximation to be valid. Let's define a range of ratios $\\dot{h}/V$ and see how the exact and approximate formulas compare."

    "The plot above shows that the exact and approximate formulas for the effective angle of attack match closely when the ratio $\\dot{h}/V$ is below approximately 0.3, corresponding to an effective angle of attack of about 17 degrees. Beyond this point, the approximation starts to deviate significantly from the exact value. However, we also know that at these angles of attack, the thin airfoil theory also starts to break down. So, in practice, the heave approximation is going to be valid as long as we remain within the applicable range of thin airfoil theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you might be wondering: what does \"Quasi-Steady\" mean? If the airfoil is in motion, things must be unsteady, so changing with time, right? The issue is that when the airfoil moves, the flow around it doesn't adjust instantly. For instance, the wake behind the airfoil takes time to change, and this affects how the forces over the airfoil evolve. What we do in quasi-steady aerodynamics is to ignore these unsteady effects and assume that the forces adjust *instantly* to the change in angle of attack. In other words, for our airfoil moving up and down, we are saying that we can prescribe whatever motion $h(t)$ we want, and at every instant in time we can calculate the aerodynamic forces using the heave approximation, which essentially treats the problem as if it was steady.\n",

    "Let's examine the two figures. In both cases, the airfoil moves up and down with the same amplitude (0.1 m). The heave speed $\\dot{h}(t)$ is the derivative of the heave motion, so it also varies harmonically but with a phase shift of 90 degrees with respect to $h(t)$ because the derivative of a sine function is a cosine function. The effective angle of attack $\\alpha_h(t)$ is directly proportional to the heave speed, so it also varies harmonically, although it appears shifted by 180 degrees due to the negative sign in the heave approximation formula. As we mentioned earlier, this is because the heave motion generates an angle of attack in the opposite direction to the motion. Finally, the lift force $L(t)$ is proportional to the effective angle of attack, so it also varies harmonically and is in phase with $\\alpha_h(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to notice is that as we increase the frequency of the heave motion from 1 Hz to 10 Hz, the amplitude of the heave speed $\\dot{h}(t)$ increases significantly (since it is proportional to frequency). Consequently, the effective angle of attack $\\alpha_h(t)$ and the lift force $L(t)$ also increase in amplitude. In addition the lift force is perfectly in phase with the angle of attack both at 1 and 10 Hz. This happens because we are assuming quasi-steady aerodynamics, where the lift responds instantaneously to changes in angle of attack. In reality, when considering full unsteady aerodynamics, the lift response would be more complex and would see at the same time an attenuation of the amplitude compared to the corresponding quasi-steady value and a phase delay with respect to the angle of attack. This phenomena are induced by the so-called _lag effects_ in the flow, meaning that the flow takes time to adjust to changes in motion.\n",

    "While it's always good to keep in mind the limitations of the assumptions we make, for the moment we we'll keep working with quasi-steady aerodynamics and neglect these lag effects. Let's move on to writing the equations of motion for our system."

In particular, we can now relate the observed motion to the roots of the characteristic equation of the system. In fact, without solving the ODE in time, we could have determined the nature of the motion just by looking at the real and imaginary parts of those roots. For instance, at 40 m/s and 80 m/s, the roots are complex conjugates with negative real parts, indicating underdamped oscillatory motion.

Wait a second, why are we talking about eigenvalues now? I'll tell you more, the eigenvalues of the system matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ are exactly the roots of the characteristic equation we derived earlier, so precisely what we are looking for! Let's unpack this together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for a system $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}} = \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{x}$ we assume a solution of the form $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} e^{\\lambda t}$, we can substitute this assumed solution into the differential equation:\n",

    "Note that the assumed solution $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} e^{\\lambda t}$ is essentially the same type of solution we used earlier for the mass-spring-damper system. The only difference here is that we are solving for a system of equations instead of a single equation, and therefore $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ is a vector instead of a scalar. This vector has the same dimension as our state vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, and in the specific case of our heave-only typical section, it has two unknown constants: one for the heave displacement and one for the heave velocity.\n",

    "Since $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} e^{\\lambda t}$ must be non-zero for a non-trivial solution, we can divide both sides by it, leading to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} = \\boldsymbol{A} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}.$$\n",
    "This is the definition of an eigenvalue problem, where $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of the assumed solution and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ is the corresponding eigenvector. To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{det}(\\boldsymbol{A} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0,$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\sum_{j} c_j \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}_j e^{\\lambda_j t},$$\n",

For our 2x2 system matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$, we will have two eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, and consequently the general solution will have the same form as the one we derived earlier for the mass-spring-damper system.\n",

    "    * At a certain speed, they become two distinct real eigenvalues (overdamped motion), meaning the system no longer has an oscillatory response.\n",

    "## 6. The Standard Aeroelastic Plots: V-g and V-f\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Root Locus is beautiful, aeroelastic engineers often prefer to split the information into two separate plots to clearly see **damping** and **frequency** trends as speed increases. These are classically known as the **V-g plot** (velocity vs damping) and the **V-f plot** (velocity vs frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Historical Note: Why \"V-g\"?** > You might wonder why we call the damping plot \"V-g plot\". The name comes from the traditional _k-method_ for flutter analysis, one of the earliest methods developed for predicting flutter speed. This method was developed when unsteady aerodynamic theories were more limited than today and mainly based on the assumption of simple harmonic motion, as they could be derived more easily than those for arbitrary motions. In fact, the k-method assumes simple harmonic motion at all flight conditions, when actually this is only true at the flutter speed. In order to force the equations to produce simple harmonic motion at all speeds, artificial structural damping is introduced as an unknown parameter that the analysis must solve for. This artificial damping was denoted as \"$g$\", and engineers would plot it against velocity to see how much damping is needed to maintain simple harmonic motion at each speed. Hence, the term \"V-g plot\" was born and has stuck around even as more advanced methods have been developed.\n",

    "Recall that from our eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we can find the frequency of oscillation $\\omega$ and damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the system using the following relationships:\n",

    "* **Damping Ratio:** $\\zeta = \\frac{-\\mathbb{Re}(\\lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\mathbb{Re}(\\lambda)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\mathbb{Im}(\\lambda)\\right)^2}}$\n",

    "## 7. Recap & Conclusion: The \"Boring\" Stability of Heave\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing Notebook 2! Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discovered about our Heave-Only model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. **Heave Approximation:** We derived the effective angle of attack for an airfoil in heave motion and found that it is proportional to the vertical velocity, with a negative sign indicating that the angle of attack is in the opposite direction to the motion. This is a valid approximation as long as the vertical motion is is much slower compared to the flight speed ($V \\gg \\dot{h}$).\n",
    "2.  **Quasi-Steady Aerodynamics:** We assumed that the lift adjusts *instantly* to changes in the angle of attack. This approximation neglects unsteady effects such as lag in the flow response, which can be significant at higher frequencies of motion.\n",
    "3.  **Aerodynamic Damping:** We mathematically proved that for an airfoil moving only in heave, the aerodynamic forces act purely as a viscous damper. The lift generated by the motion opposes the velocity, continuously removing energy from the system.\n",
    "4.  **Always Stable:** Because the aerodynamic term acts like a viscous damper, the system is unconditionally stable. No matter how fast we fly, an airfoil restricted to pure vertical motion will never flutter; it will just stop oscillating faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Missing Ingredient...\n",
    "If the aerodynamics just adds damping, how do planes actually flutter? \n",
    "History (and disaster videos) tells us that airplanes *do* break off due to flutter, so our model is missing something crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret ingredient we are missing is **Coupling**. Real wings don't just bend up and down; they also twist. When these two motions interact, energy can be transferred from the airflow to the structure, potentially leading to **Flutter Instability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coming Up Next: The 2-DOF Heave-Pitch Model\n",
    "In **Notebook 3**, we will add again the pitch DOF, this time on top of the heave DOF. We will:\n",
    "1.  Couple the Heave and Pitch equations together (2 Degrees of Freedom).\n",
    "2.  See how the \"Stiffness\" and \"Damping\" matrices become populated with off-diagonal terms.\n",
    "3.  Witness our first **Flutter Instability** using the same Quasi-Steady aerodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get ready, because the eigenvalues are about to cross the imaginary axis! 🚀\n",
