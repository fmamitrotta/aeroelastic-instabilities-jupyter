    "# Take-Home Assignment: Linear Aeroelastic Galloping\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final assignment for **Introduction to Aeroelastic Instabilities with Jupyter**! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll explore **galloping**, an interesting aeroelastic instability that affects slender structures like power lines, bridge cables, and stay cables when exposed to wind. Unlike flutter, which requires coupling between multiple degrees of freedom, galloping is a **single-degree-of-freedom instability** driven entirely by the aerodynamic characteristics of the cross-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Galloping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Galloping is a type of aeroelastic instability characterized by large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations perpendicular to the wind direction. You may have seen videos of power lines swaying dramatically in the wind, or cables on bridges oscillating with surprisingly large amplitudes. This is galloping!\n",
    "\n",
    "The key physical mechanism is that **certain cross-sectional shapes** (rectangles, D-sections, ice-covered cables) generate aerodynamic forces that can **destabilize** the structure when it moves. The secret lies in how the aerodynamic force changes with angle of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Derive** the equation of motion for the linear galloping oscillator using Lagrange's equations\n",
    "2. **Understand** the physical mechanism behind galloping instability and the role of aerodynamic force slope\n",
    "3. **Calculate** the critical galloping speed and explain the stability criterion\n",
    "4. **Analyze** system stability using root locus diagrams\n",
    "5. **Create** V-g and V-f diagrams to visualize how stability changes with airspeed\n",
    "6. **Simulate** the time-domain response at different conditions\n",
    "7. **Investigate** how system parameters affect galloping behavior\n",

    "Consider the 2D cross-section of a bluff body exposed to a uniform flow, as shown below. You can imagine this as a slice of a long rectangular prism. The body is free to oscillate in the vertical direction (heave) as it is suspended by a linear spring, it is subjected to aerodynamic forces from the wind, and its motion is resited by a linear dashpot representing the damping of the structure.\n",

    "- Height $H$ (dimension perpendicular to the flow)\n",
    "- Mass $m$ (kg)\n",
    "- Spring stiffness $k$ (N/m)\n",
    "- Dashpot damping coefficient $c$ (Ns/m)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the body can only move in the **vertical direction** (heave, $h$), perpendicular to the incoming flow. The flow has:\n",
    "- Velocity $V$ (m/s)\n",
    "- Density $\\rho$ (kg/m³)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aerodynamic Force Model\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with be familiar with the concept of the **effective angle of attack**, with the **heave approximation**, and with the assumption of **quasi-steady aerodynamics**. We introduced these concepts when we discussed the heave-only typical section in notebook 2, so feel free to review that notebook if you need a refresher!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the heave-only typical section, also our bluff body is subjected to a time-varying aerodynamic force $f_h(t)$ along the vertical direction that depends on the angle of attack $\\alpha(t)$. Given the configuration of the system, the angle of attack corresponds to the effective angle of attack $\\alpha_h(t)$, which in turn depends on the heave velocity $\\dot{h}(t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_h(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 H c_{f_h}(\\alpha(t))\\\\[1ex]\n",
    "\\alpha(t) = \\alpha_h(t) \\approx -\\frac{\\dot{h}(t)}{V},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_{f_h}(\\alpha)$ is the aerodynamic force coefficient in the vertical direction. Analogously to the case of the airfoil, this force coefficient depends on the angle of attack $\\alpha$ and it relates the aerodynamic force to the dynamic pressure and the reference length, which in this case is the height $H$ of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike streamlined airfoils where the flow remains attached and generates lift through circulation, bluff bodies like rectangular cylinders, D-sections, or ice-accreted cables experience significant **flow separation** even at small angles of attack. As the body moves or the angle of attack changes, the separation points shift along the body's surface, creating complex vortex shedding patterns and pressure distributions that can produce forces in unexpected directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, for certain cross-sectional shapes and angle of attack ranges, the transverse force coefficient $c_{f_h}(\\alpha)$ exhibits a counterintuitive behavior: as the angle of attack increases, the force can actually *decrease*, resulting in regions where $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{f_h}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha} < 0$. This negative slope is the aerodynamic fingerprint that makes galloping possible. In reality, the relationship between force and angle of attack is **highly nonlinear**. Experimental data show that $c_{f_h}(\\alpha)$ typically requires polynomial fits with multiple terms (e.g., $c_{f_h}(\\alpha) = A_1\\alpha + A_3\\alpha^3 + A_5\\alpha^5 + ...$) to capture the complete behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the linear galloping analysis, we focus solely on the behavior near the equilibrium position by retaining only the **first-order term** of this expansion: $c_{f_h}(\\alpha) \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{f_h}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}\\bigg|_{\\alpha_0} \\alpha$. This linearization is valid for small oscillations and allows us to derive an analytical expression for the critical galloping speed. The higher-order nonlinear terms, though neglected here, ultimately govern the amplitude of the limit cycle oscillations that occur in the post-critical regime. This topic lies beyond the scope of our linear analysis but, in case you are interested, it is treated comprehensively in [this book](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118756478).\n",
    "\n",
    "By retaining only the linear term, we obtain the following expression for the aerodynamic force:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_h(t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V^2 H \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{f_h}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}\\bigg|_{\\alpha_0} \\alpha_h(t).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the expression $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_{f_h}}{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}\\bigg|_{\\alpha_0}$ looks daunting, don't worry! For this assignment, it'll just correspond to a constant coefficient representing the slope of the aerodynamic force coefficient at the equilibrium position. This slope is the key parameter that determines whether galloping can occur or not."
