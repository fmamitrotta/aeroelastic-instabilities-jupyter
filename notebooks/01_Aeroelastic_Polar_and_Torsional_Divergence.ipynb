    "Hello! Welcome to **Introduction to Aeroelastic Instabilities with Jupyter Notebooks**. This is a practical, hands-on module designed for a 6-hour PhD short course taught by Francesco M. A. Mitrotta at **Politecnico di Bari** in January 2026. The course is intended for doctoral students from diverse engineering backgrounds, you don't need prior advanced aerospace engineering knowledge! We assume only basic knowledge of mechanics (forces, moments, springs) and some familiarity with differential equations. If you're comfortable with the concept of equilibrium and Hooke's law, you're ready to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical module takes a computational approach to understanding aeroelastic phenomena. Rather than spending lectures on mathematical derivations, we'll use Python and Jupyter notebooks to visualize and explore aeroelastic instabilities. The course follows a \"learn by doing\" philosophy, and students who don't know Python will learn as we work through the notebooks together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will guide you through the fundamentals of aeroelastic coupling using the **typical section model**. We'll start by deriving the aeroelastic polar, in other words how the lift force is affected by the elastic deformation of the wing, and build the foundation for understanding critical phenomena like **divergence** and **flutter**. We're going to start with physical intuition and concrete examples. Don't worry if you don't grasp every mathematical detail immediately; we'll progressively build understanding through interactive visualizations and hands-on exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best results, after you work through this notebook, experiment with the plots, modify the parameters, and observe how the system behavior changes. Try to develop physical intuition before moving to the next topic.\n",

This deformation changes the angle at which the wing meets the airflow, which in turn changes the aerodynamic forces. \n",

Schematically, we can represent the airfoil immersed in a uniform airflow with a given velocity $V$ and at a given angle of attack $\\alpha$. This configuration generates an aerodynamic force which can be decomposed into **lift** and **drag** components, respectively perpendicular and parallel to the incoming flow direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Elastic axis (EA)**: The point about which the section can rotate, restrained by a torsional spring\n",
    "2. **Aerodynamic center (AC)**: The point where the lift force is applied (at the quarter-chord, $c/4$ from leading edge, for thin airfoils at low speeds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Elastic Axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **elastic axis** is the locus of shear centers along a wing. In turn, for each cross-section of the wing, the shear center is the position where there is zero rotation for a shear load applied to that cross-section. In other words, you can think of it as the \"hinge line\" for torsional rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, we restrain this rotation with a **torsional spring** of stiffness $k_\\theta$ (units: Nm/rad), representing the wing's resistance to twisting. As you will see, the position of the elastic axis relative to the aerodynamic center is crucial for determining the aeroelastic behavior of the typical section. In real wings, the location and the meaning of the elastic axis is a more complex topic (you can read more about it in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033186)), but for our simplified model we don't have to worry about those complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the nondimensional distance $e$ between the elastic axis and the aerodynamic center as the physical distance divided by the chord length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** By convention, we define $e$ as positive when the aerodynamic center is ahead of the elastic axis. Thus, when $e > 0$, the lift acts **ahead** of the elastic axis. This configuration, as we'll see, can lead to interesting (and potentially dangerous) behavior."

    "Since air density $\\rho$ decreases with altitude, the divergence speed **increases** at higher altitudes. This is good news, and now it's your turn to explore this effect!\n",

    "#### How Air Density Varies with Altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)** model gives us the variation of air properties with altitude. You can see an illustration of this model below.\n",

    "For altitudes up to about 11 km (troposphere), the temperature decreases linearly with altitude:\n",

    "T(h) = T_0 - L h\n",

    "- $T_0 = 288.15$ K (sea level temperature)\n",
    "- $L = 0.0065$ K/m (temperature lapse rate)\n",
    "- $h$ = altitude [m]\n",
    "\n",
    "The air density is given by:\n",
    "\n",

    "- $g = 9.81$ m/s² (gravitational acceleration)\n",
    "- $R = 287$ J/(kg·K) (specific gas constant for air)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, plot altitude vs. air density from sea level to 11,000 m\n",
    "2. Then, plot altitude vs. divergence speed for the same range\n",
    "3. Comment on the results: Why does divergence become less of a concern at high altitudes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same typical section parameters as before, or experiment with different values, up to you!"

    "In this notebook, we've explored two static aeroelastic phenomena of the typical section:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Aeroelastic Polar\n",
    "\n",
    "The **aeroelastic polar** describes how the lift slope of an airfoil changes when accounting for elastic deformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "l = q c c_{l\\alpha} \\frac{k_\\theta}{k_\\theta - q e c^2 c_{l\\alpha}} \\theta_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- For $e > 0$ (AC ahead of EA): positive feedback between moment and rotation leads to steeper lift curve\n",
    "- For $e = 0$ (AC at EA): no aeroelastic coupling, behaves as rigid\n",
    "- For $e < 0$ (AC behind EA): negative feedback between moment and rotation leads to a smaller lift slope\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Torsional Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Torsional divergence** is a static aeroelastic instability that occurs when:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_\\theta = q_D e c^2 c_{l\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **divergence speed** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_\\theta}{\\rho e c^2 c_{l\\alpha}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- Only occurs for $e > 0$ (typical wing configuration)\n",
    "- Increasing $k_\\theta$ (torsional stiffness) increases $V_D$ ✓\n",
    "- Increasing $e$ (elastic axis further behind AC) decreases $V_D$ ✗\n",
    "- Lower air density (higher altitude) increases $V_D$ ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent divergence, aircraft designers:\n",
    "1. Can maximize torsional stiffness $k_\\theta$ through structural design, although this may increase weight\n",
    "2. Can control elastic axis position relative to aerodynamic center\n",
    "3. Must ensure $V_D$ exceeds maximum operating speeds with adequate margin across the different altitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll extend our model to include:\n",
    "- **Two degrees of freedom:** torsion AND plunge (heave) motion\n",
    "- **Dynamic effects:** inertial forces and time-dependent behavior\n",
    "- **Flutter:** A dynamic aeroelastic instability even more dangerous than divergence\n",
