    "# Flutter of the Heave-Pitch Typical Section with Quasi-Steady Aerodynamics\n",

    "Welcome back! 👋\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last notebook, we looked at a the typical section that could only move up and down (heave motion). We found that while it had some interesting damping behavior, it generally refused to destroy itself dynamically. In other words, it was always stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, real wings don't just bend; they also twist. And this is a key ingredient for the phenomenon of bending-torsion flutter. For this reason, in this notebook we are going to combine heave $(h)$ and pitch $(\\theta)$ motions to create a typical section model with two degrees of freedom (2-DOF).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand how heave and pitch motions couple mechanically\n",
    "2. Derive the equations of motion for the coupled system\n",
    "3. Apply quasi-steady aerodynamics to the 2-DOF system\n",
    "4. Formulate and solve the flutter eigenvalue problem\n",
    "5. Interpret V-g diagrams when instability occurs\n",

    "- **Elastic Axis (EA):** The point about which the section twists.\n",
    "    - We denote the distance from the leading edge to the EA as $\\left(1 + e\\right)b$. Essentially, $e$ represents the nondimensional offset of the EA from the mid-chord.\n",

    "## Derivation of the Equations of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system with coupled degrees of freedom like ours, deriving equations of motion using force and moment equilibrium can become algebraically messy. We'd need to carefully track forces at multiple points and resolve them through the coupling geometry. Lagrange's equations offer a more systematic approach: we express the system's energy (kinetic and potential) and let the calculus machinery handle the derivatives. This energy-based method automatically accounts for all coupling terms and is particularly elegant for systems where constraints and multiple DOFs interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is simple: we define your generalized coordinates $\\boldsymbol{q}$ (in our case, $h$ and $\\theta$), write down the kinetic energy $T$ and potential energy $V$, compute the Lagrangian $\\mathscr{L} = T - V$, and then apply Lagrange's equations to get the equations of motion.

    "   - Enables eigenvalue analysis\n",
    "   - 4 eigenvalues for a 2-DOF system (2 complex conjugate pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flutter Criteria**: Instability when eigenvalue real part becomes positive\n",
    "   - Root locus shows eigenvalue trajectories\n",
    "   - V-g diagram shows damping evolution\n",
    "   - V-f diagram shows frequency evolution\n",
